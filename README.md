This repository contains a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  The initial version of the function does not handle empty lists gracefully, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates a corrected version that handles this case by returning 0 for empty lists. This example highlights the importance of handling edge cases in function design to prevent unexpected errors.
